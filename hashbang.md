A shebang (or hashbang) is the character sequence `#!` at the beginning of a script file. It is used in Unix-like operating systems to indicate which interpreter should be used to execute the script. The shebang must be the very first line in the script file.

Here are some common examples of shebangs for different interpreters:

### Python
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, World!")
```

### Bash
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```

### Perl
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Hello, World!\n";
```

### Ruby
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Hello, World!"
```

### Node.js
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Explanation
- `#!/usr/bin/env <interpreter>`: This form of shebang uses the `env` command to find the interpreter in the user's `PATH`. It is more flexible and portable because it does not assume the interpreter is located in a specific directory.
- `#!/<path_to_interpreter>`: This form specifies the exact path to the interpreter. It is less portable but can be useful if you know exactly where the interpreter is located.

### How to Use
1. **Add Shebang**: Add the appropriate shebang line at the top of your script file.
2. **Make Script Executable**: Make your script file executable using the `chmod` command:
   ```sh
   chmod +x your_script_name
   ```
3. **Run Script**: Execute your script directly from the command line:
   ```sh
   ./your_script_name
   ```

The shebang ensures that the correct interpreter is used to run your script, making it easier to manage scripts written in different languages.
